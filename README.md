# Newton–Kepler

This is the github repo for the paper ["From Kepler to Newton: Inductive Biases Guide Learned World Models in Transformers"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06923).

Summary: [Vafa et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06952) showed that a transformer can predict planetary motion (e.g., Earth orbiting the Sun) remarkably well, even though its internal representations do not explicitly encode gravitational forces. Does this mean transformers are not valid world models? **No.** In fact, our new paper shows that sometimes the transformer is learning a *Keplerian world model*, rather than a *Newtonian world model*. Even more intriguingly, when we replace full-context attention with *local attention* (i.e., reduce the context length), the transformer begins to behave like a **Newtonian world model**. As the context length is varied, we observe a sharp and fascinating *phase transition* between these two types of world models.

For more discussion about the implications for world models, read this [blog](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/blog/2026/kepler-newton/).

## Overview

Experiments and analysis for probing inductive biases of transformers on physics-inspired tasks: **1D sine waves** and **2D Kepler orbits** (Newtonian gravity).

This folder contains:

- **Training scripts** for classification and regression transformers on discretized trajectories.
- **Analysis notebooks** that reproduce figures and analyze training dynamics, spatial representations, scaling, and block-size (context length) effects.
- **Dataset generation** for sine waves and Kepler orbits.

Notebooks expect either pretrained checkpoints (Fig 2) or results from the training scripts; each notebook describes its dependencies in the first cells.

## Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **fig2_vafa_spatial_map/** | Spatial map analysis of the pretrained transformer by Vafa et al. Loads a pretrained checkpoint and analyzes representations. **Requires checkpoint** (see below). |
| **fig3a_1d_sine_wave_embedding_evolution.ipynb** | 1D sine wave: embedding evolution over training. |
| **fig3b_1d_sine_wave_scaling_law.ipynb** | 1D sine wave: scaling law analysis. Uses results from `sine.py`. |
| **fig4_kepler_noisy_context_learning.ipynb** | Kepler: noisy context learning. |
| **fig5_regression_classification_comparison.ipynb** | Regression vs classification (Kepler). Uses results from `kepler.py` and `kepler_cv.py`. |
| **fig6_block_size_kepler_newton.ipynb** | Block size (context length) experiments for Kepler/Newton. Uses results from `kepler_cv_blocksize.py`. |
| **generate_dataset.py** | Generate and save large sine wave trajectory dataset. |
| **generate_kepler_cv.py** | Generate Kepler orbit trajectories (continuous variables) for training. |
| **sine.py** | Train transformers on 1D sine wave data. Saves to `./results/sine/`. |
| **kepler.py** | Train classification transformers on Kepler data. Saves to `./results/kepler/`. |
| **kepler_cv.py** | Train regression transformers on Kepler (continuous) data. Saves to `./results/kepler_cv/`. |
| **kepler_cv_blocksize.py** | Train with varying block size (context length). Saves to `./results/kepler_cv_blocksize/`. |
| **model.py**, **model_cv.py** | Model definitions (shared by training scripts). |

## Checkpoint (Fig 2)

The **fig2_vafa_spatial_map** analysis loads a pretrained checkpoint. If `./ckpt` or `./ckpt.pt` is missing, the notebook will raise an error and ask you to download it.

1. Download the pretrained checkpoint (e.g. `ckpt.pt`) from [inductivebiasprobe repo](https://github.com/keyonvafa/inductive-bias-probes) or their [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qfdwQE2LpeZ1shGyrbX5y4xwze-DLbCF).
2. Place the file in **fig2_vafa_spatial_map/** as `./ckpt.pt`.
3. Re-run the notebook.

Run the notebook from **fig2_vafa_spatial_map/** so that `./ckpt.pt` is in the current working directory.

## Quick start

**Small toy models you can quickly train on a CPU**
* `fig3a_*.ipynb` contains a 1D sine-wave example.
* `fig4_*.ipynb` contains a 2D Kepler example. 

## Ablation Experiments (`ablation_v2.py`, `ablation_svb.py`)

Improved training + probing pipeline with rigorous train/eval split for linear probes.

### Key improvements over `kepler_cv_blocksize.py`

| | Original | Ablation v2 |
|---|---|---|
| Probe fit data | Model train set | Model train set |
| Probe eval data | **Same data** (risk of overfitting) | **Model test set** (unseen by both model and probe) |
| Probe sampling | Random each eval step | Fixed seed, same indices every step |
| R² metric | Single R² | `train_r2` / `eval_r2` / `generalization_gap` |
| Time-step variants | `r2_all` + `r2_last` | Same + `sequence_last` |

### SVB: Singular Value Bounding (`ablation_svb.py`)

Additional regularization — clamp weight matrix singular values after each optimizer step:

$$\sigma_i \leftarrow \text{clamp}\left(\sigma_i,\; \frac{1}{1+\varepsilon},\; 1+\varepsilon\right)$$

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `svb_epsilon` | 0.0 (off) | Clamping strength; 0.5 recommended |
| `svb_freq` | 100 | Apply every N steps |

### Usage

```bash
# Baseline (no SVB)
python ablation_v2.py

# With SVB regularization
python ablation_svb.py   # uses svb_epsilon=0.5 in main()
```

### Results (block_size=100, n_layer=2)

| Metric | v2 (no SVB) | svb (ε=0.5) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Test loss | **0.00165** | 0.00236 |
| \|F\| eval R² | 0.919 | **0.954** |
| Fy eval R² | 0.645 | **0.872** |

SVB improves force representation quality but slightly hurts prediction accuracy — a representation vs. performance trade-off.
